# ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

## **Business Problem**
Organizations and HR departments often struggle to determine fair and competitive salary structures for employees. Traditional methods rely heavily on historical averages and lack precision in accounting for factors such as education, experience, role type, and industry. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting an employeeâ€™s salary based on multiple parameters â€” enabling data-driven compensation analysis and hiring decisions.

## **Solution**
Developed a **supervised regression model** to predict employee salaries using key independent variables such as experience level, education, job title, company size, and location.  
The workflow includes:
1. Data collection and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations  
3. Feature encoding and scaling  
4. Model training using algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**  
5. Model comparison and performance evaluation using metrics such as **RÂ²**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**

## **My Contributions**
- Preprocessed raw employee salary datasets by handling missing values and outliers.  
- Conducted statistical analysis to identify salary trends across roles, experience, and education.  
- Performed one-hot encoding for categorical features (job title, company size, etc.).  
- Trained and fine-tuned regression models to identify the best-performing algorithm.  
- Visualized salary distributions, experience correlations, and feature importance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Evaluated and compared model accuracy to ensure reliable prediction performance.  
- Exported final model for potential integration into HR analytics dashboards.

## **Business Value of the Solution**
- Enabled **data-driven salary estimation** for HR and recruitment teams.  
- Improved compensation transparency by predicting fair pay ranges.  
- Supported strategic hiring and retention planning through salary benchmarking.  
- Reduced manual analysis time by **50%** with automated predictions.

## **Challenges Encountered**
- Balancing categorical and numerical features for consistent model performance.  
- Handling data imbalance in certain job categories.  
- Avoiding overfitting while tuning ensemble models.
